1. What is computer vision?
2. What types of issues are solved with computer vision?
* Digit recognition
* Object recognition
* Recognition of places
* Character Recognition
* Creating new images
* Definition of distance and shape
* etc.
3. Computer vision history
* Pinhole camera (camera obscura) - nautilus pompilius eye
